/**
 * A class for dealing with raised errors, so that they don't
 * show in the unit test interface. Should be used directly,
 * rather than as a mocked object, as using the mock object to
 * compare the errors doesn't work, due to the trackback data
 * stored in PEAR_Error objects.
 * 
 * Example of use:
 *      // Set the error handling class' handleErrors() method as
 *      // the error handler for PHP for this test.
 *      $oTestErrorHandler = new TestErrorHandler();
 *      PEAR::pushErrorHandling(PEAR_ERROR_CALLBACK, array(&$oTestErrorHandler, 'handleErrors'));
 *  
 *      (test something here)     
 * 
 *      $this->assertEqual(count($oTestErrorHandler->aErrors), 1);
 *      $this->assertEqual(
 *          $oTestErrorHandler->aErrors[0]->message,
 *          'Expected Error'
 *      );
 *      $oTestErrorHandler->reset();
 * 
 *      // Unset the error handler
 *      PEAR::popErrorHandling();
