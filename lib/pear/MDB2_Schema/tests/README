This is a test framework for MDB2_Schema built using PHPUnit.
These tests directly access the MDB2_Schema API - hopefully this framework
should give better feedback as to where or what caused when error are encountered.

Usage:
In order for the tests to work you need to ensure that the user you configure
is allowed to create a new database.

To setup the tests

* requires PHPUnit to be installed

* requires MDB2 (with the given driver) as well as MDB2_Schema to be installed
  in a php include path.

* copy the file test_setup.php.dist to test_setup.php

* edit test_setup.php. The array $testarray specifies which testcases
  to carry out. $dbarray is an array of databases to test.

* point your browser at test.php or your CLI at clitest.php for the results,
  and then fix the bugs!

* by default test.php/clitest.php will use all tests in the testcases - if
  you want to pick specific tests, use testchoose.php to pick just the
  tests you want to run

Writing tests:

The tests are written using PHPUnit from pear so first make sure you
have the latest stable release, and have read the docs,
