      <a target="_blank" href="http://www.openx.org/market">OpenX Market</a> 
      enables advertisers to bid competitively to show their ads on your site. 
      If the highest bidder exceeds your specified CPM, OpenX Market will serve 
      the ad and pay you the higher revenue. Otherwise, your campaign's existing 
      ad will be delivered.
    </p>
    <p>
        We recommend that you specify a CPM that represents the effective CPM 
        that you expect to get from your campaign.
    </p>
    <p><i>Note that zones using the Image Tag type will not support OpenX Market.</i></p>
