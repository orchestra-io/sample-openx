== Prototypes ==

In order to check the behaviour of different types of logging a prototypes were created which can be used
for testing a performance of log script (lg.php).

List of prototypes:
* db_prototype - uses mysql or postgres buckets, can update buckets on each request or insert new record
                 per each request

== Requirements ==

The script requires:
* PHP5
* MySQL (or PostgreSQL)

== Installation ==

* Install openx (only mysql and postgresql are supported)
* Configure OpenX to use prototype, see section: Configuration
* Turn off automaintenance (edit config file: [maintenance]autoMaintenance=) to avoid unnecessary errors
  make performance tests more reliable
* Create buckets, see section: parameters
* Run tests, see section: Performance tests

== Configuration ==

To use a prototype module edit your var/{host}.conf.php file and set:
[origin]
type=../../../../tests/performance/delivery/buckets/prototype/db_prototype

It is possible to do a comparison tests (see "Performance tests"). To do a comparison tests run
OpenX logging once with custom prototype and another time with default raw impressions logging.
To test against default logging simply leave type empty (or comment it out).

== Parameters ==

List of parameters (can be use to drop and create buckets and to customize logging data into buckets):
* createBuckets - creates required buckets (if they don't exist already)
* dropBuckets - Use together with createBuckets, drops buckets tables before
                new buckets are created (check if bucket exist before dropping it)
* engine - engine type used to create MySQL tables, ignored if a database type is not mysql.
           There is no need to set database type, the prototype reads the db type from
           OpenX configuration file
           default=memory
* logMethod - indicates which method should be used to log new records. 
           Possible values: "update", "duplicate", "proc" or "insert"
           When used together with "createBuckets" the buckets for logMethod="insert" are created
           without primary keys so buckets may be used safely for inserts.
           When using "proc" or "duplicate", buckets should be created using "update".
           "duplicate" is MySQL only and "ON DUPLICATE UPDATE" is used.
           "proc" is PgSQL only and uses custom stored procedures for each bucket.
           default=update
* buckets - comma separated list of buckets to create or to log data into while in logging only mode,
           default=data_bucket_impression,data_bucket_impression_country,data_bucket_frequency
* rand - maximum number of random zone to choose from, eg if rand = 1000 the logging will be done
           for random 1-1000 ads and zones mt_rand(1,rand). This is to help randomize the distribution
           of records in buckets so the tests will be more reliable.
           default=1000

To create all buckets before running the performance tests use the GET parameter "createBuckets".

Example:
Following URL creates default buckets for update logging and drop old buckets table:
http://localhost/openx/trunk/www/delivery_dev/lg.php?bannerid=1&zoneid=1&createBuckets=1&dropBuckets=1&logMethod=update

== Performance tests ==

Make sure to create buckets first (see "parameters" section)
You may use apache ab to do performance tests of created prototypes.

Example:
Send 1000 requests, 50 concurrent:
# ab -n1000 -c50 'http://localhost/openx/trunk/www/delivery_dev/lg.php?bannerid=1&zoneid=1'
