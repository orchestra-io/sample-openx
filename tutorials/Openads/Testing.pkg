  When writing unit tests for OpenX (in
  {@link http://www.lastcraft.com/simple_test.php Simple Test}),
  please keep in mind that only classes and functions that actually access
  the database directly (or exist in the data access later to provide a
  convienient wrapper for such classes) should use a connection to the
  database as part of the testing process - all other classes should use
  Mock Objects or Partial Mocks if database data is required.
 </para>
 <para>
  (Obviously, Mocks and Partial Mocks can and should also be used for
  dealing with other interactions between domain layers in the
  application, when performing unit testing.)
 </para>
 <para>
  Please also keep in mind that tests need to be able to be run in 3
  different ways:
  <orderedlist>
   <listitem>Individually;</listitem>
   <listitem>As past of a group of tests; and</listitem>
   <listitem>As past of the group of all tests.</listitem>
  </orderedlist>
 </para>
 <para>
  In order to achieve this, the {@link TestRunner} class provides
  an easy way of running classes, in combination with the HTML pages
  and menu system located in the "/tests" directory.
 </para>
 <para>
  However, you will need to adhere to a strict naming convention
  in order to have your test files appear in the testing menu.
  The "config.php" file in "/tests" contains the details.
